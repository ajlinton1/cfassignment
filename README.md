TODO app

Usage: Clone repository to local machine. Open index.html in browser.

Note: Since endpoints to load/save data were provided no server side code was necessary for this project. In addition 
due to simplicity of this project some standard tools were not used e.g. WebPack, Babel, etc. The JavaScript source in 
the js folder is interpreted directly in the browser without transformation.

Tests: Open tests/todo_spec.html
